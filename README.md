# Sandy Yellow Mountain
Sandy Yellow Mountain generates land-based hash digests meant to be memorable and human-readable. Sandy Yellow Mountain is mainly thought to be used for H3Indexs giving readable names to land based hexagons.

## Example

```js
import landHash from '@srcful/sandy-yellow-mountain';

const digest = landHash('my ugly input string');
console.log(digest);
//=> Polished Peach Patternedground
```
